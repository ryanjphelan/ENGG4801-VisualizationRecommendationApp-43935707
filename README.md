Project: 

	02. Visualization recommendation system for dynamic datasets

Description: 

	Data visualization is an essential component of data analysis tasks. 
	With the availability of massive datasets both in terms of size and number of attributes, 
	the research efforts towards automatic data visualization recommendation systems are 
	becoming highly prevalent. The state of the art visulaziton recommendation systems are 
	focused on processing static data sets and are highly inefficient for frequently changing sensor data. 
	In this project we will focus on designing and implementing efficient algorithms for 
	recommending top-k most interesting visualizations for dynamic data.

Disciplines: 
	
	Information Technology, Database systems, Software, Computer systems, Algorithms and Design
